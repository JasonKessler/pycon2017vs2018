"<div class=""presentation-description"">Youâve built a fine Python web application and now youâre ready to share it with the world. But whatâs the best way to deploy your app in 2017?

This talk will demonstrate popular techniques for deploying Python web applications. Weâll start with a simple Flask application and expose it to the world five times over as we learn to use different tools and services available to the modern Python developer.

Specific topics covered include:

* Exposing your local dev environment with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)
* Using a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* Going âserverlessâ with [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
* Configuring your own VM with [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/)
* Thinking inside the box using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Weâll also briefly touch on the pros and cons of each technique to help you figure out which one is right for your app.

At the end of this talk you will have a basic understanding of how each of these techniques work and youâll be ready to try them out yourself.</div>","<p>

"<div class=""presentation-description"">smtpd.py has been in the standard library for many years.  It's been a common tool for deploying SMTP and LMTP servers that handle email-based communication in Python, providing both basic protocol implementations and a fundamental module for higher level tools, such as lazr.smtptest for testing email clients.  Based on asyncore and asynchat, smtpd.py is showing its age, and its API is unwieldy.

Fortunately, there's a new alternative available.  aiosmtpd is a modern reinvention based on asyncio, with all the improvements that come along with such a new implementation.  It provides servers for both the SMTP and LMTP protocols, as well as a higher level ""controller"" API for testing SMTP and LMTP clients.  It exposes a much better API for customization, allowing the user to associate a simple ""handler"" to process incoming messages without having to worry about the details of the protocols, and it provides some useful hooks for subclassing.

This talk will describe the purpose and history of smtpd.py and aiosmtpd, show how users can extend the servers and implement specialized handlers, and show how applications can use the testing API for ensuring that their email sending applications do the right things.  Examples will be taken from GNU Mailman 3, which uses aiosmtpd extensively.</div>","<p>

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Music is mainly an artistic act of inspired creation and is unlike some of the traditional math problems.  Music cannot be solved by a simple set of formulae. The most interesting and challenging part is producing unique music without infringing the copyright. The generated music has to sound good, and what sounds good is very subjective and varies from culture to culture.

Artificial Neural Network/Deep Learning has a wide range of applications, such as in Image processing, Natural language processing, Time series prediction, etc. But what about its usage in art? Could we use deep learning to create music? 

This talk is about how deep learning models were used to produce music - catering particularly to Bollywood.

This talk would show how an exquisite piece of art i.e. music can be generated using deep learning model which helps in automated feature extraction. In order to automate the music generation, the model must be able to remember the learned features over the longer period of time, this is achieved by a special type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) called as LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) network. 

Implementation of such complex model can be made much easier using inbuilt Python libraries such as Keras with Theano as backend. It allows for easy and fast prototyping. Packages like numpy and scipy are being used for easier mathematical computation of input vectors and for reading/writing the WAV files respectively. The neural network architecture makes use of numerous amount of music samples to train the model. After an adequate number of iterations and training time, this model generates music that is unique and original. 

In this talk, steps involved in preprocessing of data, training the model, testing the model and generating the music from the trained model will be discussed. This talk will also cover some of the challenges and tradeoffs made for algorithmic music generation.

"<div class=""presentation-description"">As the applications we build are increasingly driven by text, doing data ingestion, management, loading, and preprocessing in a robust, organized, parallel, and memory-safe way can get tricky. This talk walks through the highs (a custom billion-word corpus!), the lows (segfaults, 400 errors, pesky mp3s), and the new Python libraries we built to ingest and preprocess text for machine learning.

While applications like Siri, Cortana, and Alexa may still seem like novelties, language-aware applications are rapidly becoming the new norm. Under the hood, these applications take in text data as input, parse it into composite parts, compute upon those composites, and then recombine them to deliver a meaningful and tailored end result. The best applications use language models trained on _domain-specific corpora_ (collections of related documents containing natural language) that reduce ambiguity and prediction space to make results more intelligible. Here's the catch: these corpora are huge, generally consisting of at least hundreds of gigabytes of data inside of thousands of documents, and often more!

In this talk, we'll see how working with text data is substantially different from working with numeric data, and show that ingesting a raw text corpus in a form that will support the construction of a data product is no trivial task. For instance, when dealing with a text corpus, you have to consider not only how the data comes in (e.g. respecting rate limits, terms of use, etc.), but also where to store the data and how to keep it organized. Because the data comes from the web, it's often unpredictable, containing not only text but audio files, ads, videos, and other kinds of web detritus. Since the datasets are large, you need to anticipate potential performance problems and ensure memory safety through streaming data loading and multiprocessing. Finally, in anticipation of the machine learning components, you have to establish a standardized method of transforming your raw ingested text into a corpus that's ready for computation and modeling.

In this talk, we'll explore many of the challenges we experienced along the way and introduce two Python packages that make this work a bit easier: [Baleen](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/baleen/0.3.3) and [Minke](https://github.com/bbengfort/minke).

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Python 3.6 was released in December of 2016 and it has a lot of new cool features.

&gt;&gt; Monty Python and the Holy Grail; Scene 33

Python 3 has been around for more than eight years, and much of the Python
ecosystem is now available both on Python 2 and Python 3, often using a single
code base. Nonetheless, this compatibility comes at a development cost and some
library authors are considering ending support for Python 2 . These
once-python-2-compatible libraries are at risk of being upgraded on non
compatible system and cause user (and developer) frustration.

While it may seem simple to cease support for Python 2, the challenge is not in
ending support, but doing so in a way that does not wreak havoc for users who
stay on Python 2. And that is not only a communications problem, but a
technical one : up until recently, it was impossible to tag a release as Python
3 only; today it is possible.

Like any maintainer of a widely used library, we want to ensure that users
continue to use Python 2 continue to have functioning libraries, even after
development proceeds in a way that does not support Python 2. 

One approach is to ensure easy installation of older versions if possible avoid
incompatible versions altogether. Users should not need to manually pin maximal
version dependencies across their development environments and projects if all
they want is to use the latest versions of libraries that are compatible with
their system.

Even if we did expect that of users, consider what would happen when a package
they rely on converts to be only Python 3 compatible. If they were not tracking
the complete dependency tree, they might discover, on  upgrade, that their
projects no longer work. To avert this they would need to pin those at the last
version compatible with Python 2. Users that want to use older python versions
should not have to go through so much anguish to do so. 

In order to solve this problem, and thereby make both users' and maintainers'
lives easier, we ventured into the rabbit-hole called Packaging.

Though we set off with a singular quest, our tale roves through many lands.
We'll narrate the story of our amending PEPs, our efforts in building the
ramparts of the pypa/Warehouse Castle, battles with the dragons of Pip, and
errands in the ""land of no unit tests"" otherwise known as PyPI legacy.

By the end of the above tale, the audience members will know the road to Python
3 only libraries had once had hazards that are now easily avoidable. So long as

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Recently, networking vendors and Silicon Valley giants have been putting forth a concerted effort to build standardized models for networking devices. These models allow for building reusable and versatile scripts with predictable, standardized data. Without such models, the wide variety of inputs and outputs required by different devices and vendors made scripting a tedious and challenging endeavor. The modeling language in use is called YANG, and a variety of standards have emerged. A vendor agnostic standard called OpenConfig has lately become stable enough to begin programming devices with it. Using Python, YANG is surprisingly easy to work with, and extremely powerful applications can be written with basic knowledge of JSON or XML and RPCs. 

The talk will start with use-cases for programming networking devices, and will detail a specific, trivial, use case that will be used in the talk. Next, we will discuss the âlegacyâ way of programming devices (SSH and screenscraping), and highlight the challenges, such as complex regular expressions, slow responses, and lack of reusability between devices. From there we will dive into YANG, focusing on OpenConfig models. A YANG model is essentially a template, and JSON or XML can be mapped to the YANG template. This makes it perfect for Pythonic manipulation. In the use case there will be a GET RPC returning a YANG representation of the boxâs state in JSON, which we will search for the relevant health indicator by drilling down in the JSON dictionary. A simple change to the dictionary will remediate the problem, and a PATCH RPC merges the new configuration onto the box. Since open, standard models are in use, this script could be run on many devices across a network to achieve the same effect with no changes needed. We will finish up with the pros and cons of YANG before opening the talk for Q&amp;A.</div>","<p>

        Exploring Network Programmability with Python and YANG
      </a>",2017,"Recently, networking vendors and Silicon Valley giants have been putting forth a concerted effort to build standardized models for networking devices. These models allow for building reusable and versatile scripts with predictable, standardized data. Without such models, the wide variety of inputs and outputs required by different devices and vendors made scripting a tedious and challenging endeavor. The modeling language in use is called YANG, and a variety of standards have emerged. A vendor agnostic standard called OpenConfig has lately become stable enough to begin programming devices with it. Using Python, YANG is surprisingly easy to work with, and extremely powerful applications can be written with basic knowledge of JSON or XML and RPCs. 

The talk will start with use-cases for programming networking devices, and will detail a specific, trivial, use case that will be used in the talk. Next, we will discuss the ’legacy’ way of programming devices (SSH and screenscraping), and highlight the challenges, such as complex regular expressions, slow responses, and lack of reusability between devices. From there we will dive into YANG, focusing on OpenConfig models. A YANG model is essentially a template, and JSON or XML can be mapped to the YANG template. This makes it perfect for Pythonic manipulation. In the use case there will be a GET RPC returning a YANG representation of the box’s state in JSON, which we will search for the relevant health indicator by drilling down in the JSON dictionary. A simple change to the dictionary will remediate the problem, and a PATCH RPC merges the new configuration onto the box. Since open, standard models are in use, this script could be run on many devices across a network to achieve the same effect with no changes needed. We will finish up with the pros and cons of YANG before opening the talk for Q&A.",Lisa N Roach Saturday 12:10 p.m.12:40 p.m. in Portland Ballroom 252253

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Fuzzy Searching or approximate string matching is powerful because often text data is messy. For example, shorthand and abbreviated text are common in various data sets. In addition, outputs from OCR or voice to text conversions tend to be messy or imperfect. Thus, we want to be able to make the most of our data by extrapolating as much information as possible. 

In this talk, we will explore the various approaches used in fuzzy string matching and demonstrate how they can be used as a feature in a model or a component in your python code. We will dive deep into the approaches of different algorithms such as Soundex, Trigram/n-gram search, and Levenshtein distances and what the best use cases are. We will also discuss situations where itâs important to take into account the meaning or intent of a word and demonstrate approaches for measuring semantic similarity using nltk and word2vec. Furthermore, we will demonstrate via live coding how to implement some of these fuzzy search algorithms using python and/or built-in fuzzy search functions within PostgreSQL.

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Nearly everyone (especially in the Python community) agrees that good documentation is important to the success of software projects, and yet very few projects actually have good documentation.

Often, it's _not for want of effort_ - the project's developers have worked hard on it - _nor for lack of documentation_ - the authors have produced a lot of it. 

_It simply turns out to be not very good_ - not helpful enough for the users who should be able to rely on it, and a depressing chore for the authors who have to maintain it.

The good news is that both these problems can be solved by understanding _how documentation works_, and what its different functions are. Structuring documentation according to those distinct functions helps ensure that each of them is adequately served. It also makes it far easier to write and maintain.

Using real-life examples I'll draw out the key functions of documentation, and how they map onto different ways of writing it. Putting this into practice is simple when armed with some basic guidelines. The benefits are huge, and available with a minimum of effort.

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Over the last several years, Python developers interested in data science and analytics have acquired a variety of tools and libraries that aim to facilitate analytical processes. Libraries such as Pandas, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Yellowbrick have made tasks such as data wrangling, statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization much quicker and easier. They have accomplished this by automating and abstracting away some of the more tedious, repetitive processes involved with analyzing and modeling data. 

Over the next few years, we are sure to witness the introduction of new tools that are increasingly intelligent and have the ability to automate more complex analytical processes. However, as we begin using these tools (and developing new ones), we should strongly consider the level of automation that is most appropriate for each case. Some analytical processes are technically difficult to automate, and therefore require large degrees of human steering. Others are relatively easy to automate but perhaps should not be due to the unpredictability of results or outputs requiring a level of compassionate decision-making that machines simply donât possess. Such processes would benefit greatly from the collaboration between automated machine tasks and uniquely human ones. After all, it is often systems that utilize a combination of both human and machine intelligence that achieve better results than either could on their own. 

In this talk, we will discuss human-machine collaboration as it applies to analyzing data with Python. We will review a framework for exploratory data analysis with the goal of identifying which tasks should be automated, which tasks should not, and which tasks would benefit from a more interactive, symbiotic, and collaborative process between the human and the machine. We will explore Python libraries that we can use to build tools that allow us to perform different types of analysis. Weâll also introduce the Cultivar project, an example of a hybrid analytics tool that combines a Django framework with Javascript visualizations and Celery for task management to facilitate more efficient and effective human-machine systems for data analysis.

In this talk, we’ll explore how to leverage event-driven programming, or ""async I/O"", to structure code in such a way that its tests are fast, realistic, and reliable, even in the face of horrible race-conditions you only discover in production.",Glyph Friday 10:50 a.m.11:20 a.m. in Portland Ballroom 252253

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Working with time is not a trivial challenge. Python includes a native module in the standard library to work with it but datetime keeps being together with unicode a common source of errors. This often leads to the widespread of many other libraries in the attempt of easing the work of working with datetime. Datetime is one of those API that looks easy to use but given the many concepts around time, is it easy to get backfired if the developer has not solid knowledge about the them.

In this talk we will overview the main concepts about timestamps represented through datetime objects, the limitations on the standard library and some simple steps to try to avoid the common mistakes that everyone can fall into.

Naive datetimes (which the datetime API works by default with) are a great tool to represent calendar times, but when talking about timestamps (focus of this talk) timezones is n essential part of it and the datetime module can be tricky to use for that use cases.

We will also speak about different standards of time, time zones, Daylight Saving Times, leap seconds, serialization and datetime arithmetics.

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Various optimizations made Python 3.6 faster than Python 3.5. Let's see in detail what was done and how.

Python 3.6 is faster than any other Python version on many benchmarks. We will see results of the Python benchmark suite on Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6.

The bytecode format and instructions to call functions were redesign to run bytecode faster.

A new C calling convention, called ""fast call"", was introduced to avoid temporary tuple and dict. The way Python parses arguments was also optimized using a new internal cache.

Operations on bytes and encodes like UTF-8 were optimized a lot thanks to a new API to create bytes objects. The API allows very efficient optimizations and reduces memory reallocations.

        Optimizations which made Python 3.6 faster than Python 3.5
      </a>",2017,"Various optimizations made Python 3.6 faster than Python 3.5. Let’s see in detail what was done and how.

Python 3.6 is faster than any other Python version on many benchmarks. We will see results of the Python benchmark suite on Python 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6.

The bytecode format and instructions to call functions were redesign to run bytecode faster.

A new C calling convention, called ""fast call"", was introduced to avoid temporary tuple and dict. The way Python parses arguments was also optimized using a new internal cache.

Operations on bytes and encodes like UTF-8 were optimized a lot thanks to a new API to create bytes objects. The API allows very efficient optimizations and reduces memory reallocations.

Some parts of asyncio were rewritten in C to speedup code up to 25%. The PyMem_Malloc function now also uses the fast pymalloc allocator also giving tiny speedup for free.

Finally, we will see optimization projects for Python 3.7: use fast calls in more cases, speed up method calls, a cache on opcodes, a cache on global variables.",Victor Stinner Friday 10:50 a.m.11:20 a.m. in Portland Ballroom 251 & 258

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Companies with an artificial-intelligence plan have a differentiating strategy in the intelligence economy; however, implementing robust machine-learning in production is nontrivial, often requiring a close collaboration between data scientists and developers, and retooling the production stack and workflows to develop and maintain accurate models.  

Machine learning in production involves model application, handling missing data, data artifacts, and data outside of the training calibration.  A rigorous evaluation framework draws upon logging to determine characteristics of model coverage, model performance, auditing, and run-time performance.  Model coverage includes the number of times the model produced sensible output relative to number of times it is called.  Model coverage is reduced if the model does not converge or model criteria are not met.  Model performance is evaluated with a suite of metrics (accuracy, AUC, FPR, TPR, RMSE, MAPE, etc.), which assist in determining the most appropriate model to use in the production scenario and the validity of the model training.  Regularly performing manual audits for spot checks is important for debugging and ensuring the model passes sanity checks.  Model performance includes run times and profiling model pieces, ensuring performance is within specified requirements and refactoring otherwise.

In the AI renaissance, where ML is a critical piece of intelligent products, seamlessly integrating model evaluation into workflows is an important component of making robust products and building a satisfying customer experience.  Python is a great language to build intelligent products with its abundance of ML libraries and wrappers contributed as open-source software in addition to rich full-stack capabilities.

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Lazy evaluation, also known as ""call by need"", is an evaluation strategy where
values are produced only when needed. Lazy evaluation is the opposite of eager
evaluation, Python's normal evaluation model, where functions are executed as
seen and values are produced immediately.

In this talk we will define lazy evaluation and contrast it with eager
evaluation. We will discuss tools that exist in Python for using lazy evaluation
and show how we can build on the primitives to better represent computations. We
will introduce common vocabulary for discussing evaluation models, and compare
different systems for implementing lazy evaluation. Finally, we will discuss
optimizations that can be made to optimize lazily evaluated expressions.

Averages are something we use everywhere - it’s a simple np.mean() in pandas or AVG() in SQL. But recently I’ve come to appreciate just how easy it is to calculate this statistic incorrectly. We learn once - in middle school no less - how to take an average, and never revisit it. Then, when we are faced with multidimensional datasets (ie. pretty much every dataset out there), we never reconsider whether we should be taking an average the same way.

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Recommender systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, and are used by some of the largest websites in the world to predict the likelihood of a user taking an action on an item. In the world of Netflix, this means recommending similar movies to the ones you have seen. In the world of dating, this means suggesting matches similar to people you already showed interest in!

My path to recommenders has been an unusual one: from a Software Engineer to working on matching algorithms at a dating company, with a little background on machine learning. With my knowledge of Python and the use of basic SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) frameworks, I was able to understand SVDs from a practical standpoint of what you can do with them, instead of focusing on the science.

In my talk, you will learn 2 practical ways of generating recommendations using SVDs: matrix factorization and item similarity. We will be learning the high-level components of SVD the ""doer way"": we will be implementing a simple movie recommendation engine with the help of Jupiter notebooks, the MovieLens database, and the Surprise recommendation package.

        A practical guide to Singular Value Decomposition in Python
      </a>",2018,"Recommender systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, and are used by some of the largest websites in the world to predict the likelihood of a user taking an action on an item. In the world of Netflix, this means recommending similar movies to the ones you have seen. In the world of dating, this means suggesting matches similar to people you already showed interest in!

My path to recommenders has been an unusual one: from a Software Engineer to working on matching algorithms at a dating company, with a little background on machine learning. With my knowledge of Python and the use of basic SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) frameworks, I was able to understand SVDs from a practical standpoint of what you can do with them, instead of focusing on the science.

In my talk, you will learn 2 practical ways of generating recommendations using SVDs: matrix factorization and item similarity. We will be learning the high-level components of SVD the ""doer way"": we will be implementing a simple movie recommendation engine with the help of Jupiter notebooks, the MovieLens database, and the Surprise recommendation package.",Daniel Pyrathon Sunday 1:50 p.m.2:20 p.m. in Room 26A/B/C

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Writing quality Python code can be both tough and tedious. On top of the general design, there are many code quality aspects that you need to watch out for when writing and reviewing code such as adherence to PEP8, docstring quality, test quality, etc. Furthermore, everyone is human. If you are catching these code quality issues by hand, there is a good chance that at some point you will miss an easy opportunity to improve code quality. If the quality check can be done by a machine, then why would you even try to catch the code quality issue by hand? In the end, the machine will be able to perform the quality check with much more speed, accuracy, and consistency than a person.

This talk will dive into how existing open source projects offload and automate many of these code quality checks resulting in:

- A higher quality and a more consistent codebase
- Maintainers being able to focus more on the higher level design and interfaces
  of a project.
- An improved contribution process and higher quality pull requests from
  external contributors

By diving into how these open source projects automate code quality checks, you will learn about:

- The available tooling related to checking code quality such as `flake8`,
  `pylint`, `coverage`, etc.
- How to automate code quality checks for both a development and team 
  setting.
- First-hand accounts of the benefits and lessons learned from automating
  code quality checks in real-life open source projects.

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Nowadays, there are many ways of building data science models using Python, including statistical and machine learning methods. I will introduce probabilistic models, which use Bayesian statistical methods to quantify all aspects of uncertainty relevant to your problem, and provide inferences in simple, interpretable terms using probabilities.  A particularly flexible form of probabilistic models uses Bayesian *non-parametric* methods, which allow models to vary in complexity depending on how much data are available. In doing so, they avoid the over-fitting that is common in machine learning and statistical modeling.

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is gaining popularity as an improved way to collaborate over product features and tests. In Python, **behave** is one of the leading BDD test frameworks. Using **behave**, teams write Gherkin behavior scenarios (e.g., tests) in plain language, and then programmers write Python code to automate the steps. BDD testing is great because tests are self-documenting and steps abide by the DRY principle. An example test could be:

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Python now offers static types! Companies like Dropbox and Facebook, and open-source projects like Zulip, use static types (with [PEP 484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) and [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy)) to make Python more productive and fun to work with — in existing codebases from 40k lines to 4 million, in Python 2 and 3, and while preserving the conciseness and flexibility that make Python a great language in the first place. I’ll describe how.

Reading and understanding code is a huge part of what we do as software developers. If we make it easier to understand our codebases, we make everyone more productive, help each other write fewer bugs, and lower barriers for new contributors. That's why Python now features optional static types, and why Dropbox, [Facebook](https://engineering.instagram.com/let-your-code-type-hint-itself-introducing-open-source-monkeytype-a855c7284881), and [Zulip](https://blog.zulip.org/2016/10/13/static-types-in-python-oh-mypy/) use them on part or all of their Python code.

In this talk, I’ll share lessons from Zulip’s and Dropbox’s experience — having led the mypy team at Dropbox and working now on the Zulip core team — for how you can start using static types in your own codebases, large or small. We’ll discuss how to make it a seamless part of your project’s tooling; what order to approach things in; and powerful new tools that make it even easier today to add static types to your Python codebase than ever before.

        Clearer Code at Scale: Static Types at Zulip and Dropbox
      </a>",2018,"Python now offers static types! Companies like Dropbox and Facebook, and open-source projects like Zulip, use static types (with [PEP 484] and [mypy]) to make Python more productive and fun to work with — in existing codebases from 40k lines to 4 million, in Python 2 and 3, and while preserving the conciseness and flexibility that make Python a great language in the first place. I’ll describe how.

Reading and understanding code is a huge part of what we do as software developers. If we make it easier to understand our codebases, we make everyone more productive, help each other write fewer bugs, and lower barriers for new contributors. That’s why Python now features optional static types, and why Dropbox, [Facebook], and [Zulip] use them on part or all of their Python code.

In this talk, I’ll share lessons from Zulip’s and Dropbox’s experience — having led the mypy team at Dropbox and working now on the Zulip core team — for how you can start using static types in your own codebases, large or small. We’ll discuss how to make it a seamless part of your project’s tooling; what order to approach things in; and powerful new tools that make it even easier today to add static types to your Python codebase than ever before.",Greg Price Sunday 1:50 p.m.2:20 p.m. in Grand Ballroom B
"<div class=""presentation-description"">As engineers, we care a lot about the reliability of our applications. When a website falls over, pagers go off, and engineers burst into action to bring a site back to life.  Postmortems are written, and teams develop strategies to prevent similar failures in the future.

But what about the reliability of our data? Would _you_ trust financial reports built on your data? 

If not, what can you do to improve data health? If you _would_ trust these reports, how can you prove to customers, investors, and auditors alike that they should too?

In this talk, you’ll learn to apply strategies from the world of dev-ops to data. You’ll learn about questions auditors ask that can help you pinpoint data problems. You’ll also learn some accounting-specific tools for accurate and timely record keeping that I’ve found fascinating and helpful!

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Data Visualization charts are supposed to be our map to information. However, when making charts, customarily we are just re-sizing lines and circles based on metrics instead of creating data-driven version of reality.  The contemporary charting techniques have a few shortcomings (especially when dealing with high-dimensional dataset): 

* **Context Reduction**: in order to fit a high-dimensional dataset into a chart one needs to filter/ aggregate/ flatten data which results in reduction of full context of information.  Without context most of the charts show only a part of the story, that can potentially lead to data misinterpretation/misunderstanding. 
* **Numeric Thinking**: naturally humans have hard time perceiving big numbers. While data visualization is suppose to help us to conceptualize large volumes,  unless the dataset is carefully prepared, 2D charts rarely give us the intuitive grasp of magnitude. 
* **Perceptual de-humanization**: when examining charts it is easy to forget that we are dealing with activity in real world instead of lines/bars. 

Augmented/Mixed Reality can potentially solve all of the issues listed above by presenting an intuitive and interactive environment for data exploration. Three dimensional space provides conditions to create complex data stories with more “realistic assets” (beyond lines and bars).

The patch function is in particular confusing- there are many different ways to use it. Should I use a context manager? Decorator? When would I use it manually? Improperly used patch functions can make unit tests useless, all the while making them look as if they are correctly testing code.Let’s learn how to wield patch with confidence!",Lisa Roach Friday 12:10 p.m.12:55 p.m. in Grand Ballroom B

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Anyone who is interested in deep learning has gotten their hands dirty playing around with Tensorflow, Google's open source deep learning framework. Tensorflow has its benefits like wide scale adoption, deployment on mobile, and support for distributed computing, but it also has a somewhat challenging learning curve, is difficult to debug, and hard to deploy in production. PyTorch is a new deep learning framework that solves a lot of those problems.

PyTorch is only in beta, but users are rapidly adopting this modular deep learning framework. PyTorch supports tensor computation and dynamic computation graphs that allow you to change how the network behaves on the fly unlike static graphs that are used in frameworks such as Tensorflow. PyTorch offers modularity which enhances the ability to debug or see within the network and for many, is more intuitive to learn than Tensorflow.

This talk will objectively look at PyTorch and why it might be the best fit for your deep learning use case and we'll look at use cases that will showcase why you might want consider using Tensorflow instead.

* Establish a good communication system with your contributors: Keep them informed, listen to their feedback and input, make them feel heard. 
* Thank the people who worked on ticket triage or marketing, not just those who wrote code, in your release notes. 
* Make it easy for new contributors to get started: Write and maintain good documentation, answer questions in a friendly and timely manner. 
* Market and evangelize in the right places and at the right time: Give conference talks, organize sprints, keep your project’s Twitter account active, always curate new and interesting content on your blog or website.

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Resources are files that live within Python packages.  Think test data files, certificates, templates, translation catalogs, and other static files you want to access from Python code.  Sometimes you put these static files in a package directory within your source tree, and then locate them by importing the package and using its `__file__` attribute.  But this doesn't work for zip files!

You could use `pkg_resources`, an API that comes with `setuptools` and hides the differences between files on the file system and files in a zip file.  This is great because you don't have to use `__file__`, but it's not so great because `pkg_resources` is a big library and can have potentially severe performance problems, even at import time.

Welcome to `importlib.resources`, a new module and API in Python 3.7 that is also available as a standalone library for older versions of Python.  `importlib.resources` is build on top of Python's existing import system, so it is very efficient.  It also defines an abstract base class which loaders can implement to provide their own resource access.  Python's built-in zipimporter uses this to provide efficient access to resources within a zip file.  Third party import hooks can do the same, so resources can come from anything that is importable by Python.

This talk will step through the motivations behind `importlib.resources`, the library's usage, its interfaces, and the hooks made available to third party packages.  It will also talk about the minor differences between the standalone version and the version in Python 3.7's standard library.

        How to Write Deployment-friendly Applications
      </a>",2018,"The DevOps movement gave us many ways to put Python applications into production.  But should your *application* care?  Should it need to know whether it’s running on your notebook, on a server, in a Docker container, or in some cloud platform as a service?

It should not, because environment-agnostic applications are easier to **test**, easier to **deploy**, easier to **handle**, and easier to **scale**.

But how can you *practically* structure and configure your applications to make them indifferent to the environment they run in?  How do secrets fit into the picture?  And where do you put that log file?

By the end of this talk you’ll know the tools and techniques that enable you to write such Python applications and you’ll be ready for the next big change.",Hynek Schlawack Saturday 4:15 p.m.5 p.m. in Grand Ballroom A
"<div class=""presentation-description"">New conferences rarely have resources to run the sort of outreach and inclusion programs that big conferences have. It’s hard to guess how much money you’ll have to spend, how many attendees you’ll have, and what your new community will look like. With so many things to worry about, it’s no surprise that most events don’t prioritise outreach until they’ve got a few years under their belt, if at all.

It doesn’t have to be this way, and it can even be easier to build a new event around outreach and inclusion than it is to build it in later on!

This talk shares the story of North Bay Python’s inaugural conference, which we planned in under 6 months, ran on a $40,000 budget, and built a welcoming community to make it real. We made inclusivity a founding principle and did so without compromising our speaker lineup while still attracting great sponsorship and hosted an event that almost every attendee wants to return to.

In this talk, we’re going to share with you how we built a conference, from the ground up, to be as inclusive as we could make it. We’ll touch on early organisation, marketing, and on-the ground logistics. Throughout the talk, you’ll learn:

* How we designed a budget that let us prioritise outreach and inclusion activities
* How we built the community that we wanted before the conference even started
* How we ran an event that proved that we meant everything we said

You too can host a new conference with a great lineup on a shoestring budget and short timeline, and you can do it while being inclusive, welcoming, and putting attendee safety first. Find out how you can have your cake, eat it, and still have lots to share with your new community.

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Imagine you have an appointment in a large building you do not know. Your host sent instructions describing how to reach their office. Though the instructions were fairly clear, in a few places, such as at the end, you had to infer what to do. How does a _robot (agent)_ interpret an instruction in the environment to infer the correct course of action? Enabling harmonious _Human - Robot Interaction_ is of primary importance if they are to work seamlessly alongside people.

Dealing with natural language instructions in hard because of two main reasons, first being, Humans - through their prior experience know how to interpret natural language but agents can’t, and second is overcoming the ambiguity that is inherently associated with natural language instructions. This talk is about how deep learning models were used to solve such complex and ambiguous problem of converting natural language instruction into its corresponding action sequence.

Following verbal route instructions requires knowledge of language, space, action and perception. In this talk I shall be presenting, a neural sequence-to-sequence model for direction following, a task that is essential to realize effective autonomous agents.

At a high level, a sequence-to- sequence model is an end-to-end model made up of two recurrent neural networks: 

 - **Encoder** - which takes the model’s input sequence as input and encodes it into a fixed-size context vector.
 - **Decoder** - which uses the context vector from above as a seed from which to generate an output sequence. 

For this reason, sequence-to-sequence models are often referred to as _encoder-decoder_ models. The alignment based encoder-decoder model would translate the natural language instructions into corresponding action sequences. This model does not assume any prior linguistic knowledge: syntactic, semantic or lexical. The model learns the meaning of every word, including object names, verbs, spatial relations as well as syntax and the compositional semantics of the language on its own.

In this talk, steps involved in pre-processing of data, training the model, testing the model and final simulation of the model in the virtual environment will be discussed. This talk will also cover some of the challenges and trade-offs made while designing the model.</div>","<p>

"<div class=""presentation-description"">The end of life for Python 2 is 2020. Python 3 is the future and you'll need to consider both your upgrade plan and what steps you'll take after upgrading to start leveraging Python 3 features.

During this talk we'll briefly discuss how to start **the process of upgrading your code to Python 3**. We'll then dive into some of **the most useful Python 3 features** that you'll be able to start embracing once you drop Python 2 support.

A number of the most powerful Python 3 features are syntactic features that are **Python 3 only**. You won't get any experience using these features until you fully upgrade. These features are an incentive to drop Python 2 support in existing 2 and 3 compatible code. You can consider this talk as a teaser of Python 3 features that you may have never used.

        Python 2 to 3: How to Upgrade and What Features to Start Using
      </a>",2018,"The end of life for Python 2 is 2020. Python 3 is the future and you’ll need to consider both your upgrade plan and what steps you’ll take after upgrading to start leveraging Python 3 features.

During this talk we’ll briefly discuss how to start **the process of upgrading your code to Python 3**. We’ll then dive into some of **the most useful Python 3 features** that you’ll be able to start embracing once you drop Python 2 support.

A number of the most powerful Python 3 features are syntactic features that are **Python 3 only**. You won’t get any experience using these features until you fully upgrade. These features are an incentive to drop Python 2 support in existing 2 and 3 compatible code. You can consider this talk as a teaser of Python 3 features that you may have never used.

After this talk I hope you’ll be inspired to fully upgrade your code to Python 3.",Trey Hunner Saturday 4:30 p.m.5 p.m. in Grand Ballroom C

"<div class=""presentation-description"">The WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) specification for hosting Python web applications was created in 2003. Measured in Internet time, it is ancient. The oldest main stream implementation of the WSGI specification is mod_wsgi, for the Apache HTTPD server and it is over 10 years old.

WSGI is starting to be regarded as not up to the job, with technologies such as HTTP/2, web sockets and async dispatching being the way forward. Reality is that WSGI will be around for quite some time yet and for the majority of use cases is more than adequate.

The real problem is not that we need to move to these new technologies, but that we aren't using the current WSGI servers to their best advantage. Moving to a new set of technologies will not necessarily make things better and will only create a new set of problems you have to solve.

As one of the oldest WSGI server implementations, Apache and mod\_wsgi may be regarded as boring and not cool, but it is still the most stable option for hosting WSGI applications available. It also hasn't been sitting still, with a considerable amount of development work being done on mod\_wsgi in the last few years to make it even more robust and easier to use in a development environment as well as production, including in containerised environments.

In this talk you will learn about many features of mod\_wsgi which you probably didn't even know existed, features which can help towards ensuring your Python web application deployment performs to its best, is secure, and has a low maintenance burden.

Topics which will be covered include:

* Easy deployment of Python web applications using mod\_wsgi-express.
* Integration of mod_wsgi-express with a Django web application.
* Using mod\_wsgi-express in a development environment.
* How to make use of mod\_wsgi-express in a production environment.
* Using mod_wsgi-express in a containerised runtime environment.
* Ensuring consistency between development and production environments using warpdrive.
* Using mod\_wsgi-express to bootstrap a system Apache installation for hosting WSGI applications.
* Why you should be using daemon mode of mod\_wsgi and not embedded mode.
* How to properly associate mod\_wsgi with a Python virtual environment.
* Building a robust deployment that can recover from misbehaving application code, backend services, or request overloading.
* Using hooks provided by mod\_wsgi to monitor the performance of your Python web application.

If you are a beginner, come learn why mod\_wsgi is still a good option for deploying your Python web applications. If you are an old time user of mod\_wsgi, find out about all the features you probably didn't know existed, revisit your current Python web application deployment and make it even better.</div>","<p>

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Done! Your shiny new application is functionally complete and ready to be deployed to production! But how exactly do you deploy properly on Linux? Wonder no more! In 30 minutes, this talk explains how you can harness the power of the init system and systemd to solve common deployment problems, including some that you didn't even know you had. Examples of things we will cover:

* How to secure your system by having: private /tmp for your process, read-only paths so that your process can not write to them, inaccessible paths, protect users home, network access, bin directories, etc.
* How to limit the resources you app can consume.
* How to interact directly with systemd, so it can start transient units, start/stop services, mount disks, resolve addresses.
* How to isolate your service without containers.
* How to isolate your service using containers (using systemd to spawn a namespace).

All this will be covered from a Python developer's perspective.

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Projects fail in droves. Systems hiccup and hours of downtime follows. Screws fall out all the time; the world is an imperfect place.

We talk a lot about building resilient systems, but all systems are (at least for now) built by humans. Humans who have been making the same types of mistakes for thousands of years. 

Just because failure happens doesn’t mean we can’t do our best to prevent it or—at the very least—to minimize the damage when it does. As a matter of fact, embracing failure can be one of the best things you do for your system. Failure is a vital part of evolution. By learning to love failure we learn how to take the next step forward. Ignoring or punishing failure leads to stagnation and wasted potential.

This talk distills 3000 pages of failure research into 40 minutes of knowledge about the human factors of failure, how it can be recognised, and how you can work around it to create more resilient systems.

"<div class=""presentation-description"">All the data in the world is useless if you cannot understand it. EDA and data visualization are the most crucial yet overlooked stage in analytics process. This is because they give insights on the most relevant features in a particular data set required to build an accurate model. It is often said that the more the data, the better the model but sometimes, this can be counter-productive as more data can be a disadvantage. EDA helps avoid that.

EDA is useful for professionals while data visualization is useful for end-users. 

For end-users: 
A good sketch is better than a long speech. The value of a machine learning model is not known unless it is used to make data driven decisions. It is therefore necessary for data scientists to master the act of telling a story for their work to stay relevant. This is where data visualization is extremely useful.  
We must remember that the end-users of the results are not professionals like us but people who know little or nothing about data analysis. For effective communication of our analysis, there is need for a detailed yet simple data visualization because the work of a data scientist is not done if data-driven insights and decisions are not made.

For professionals:
How do you ensure you are ready to use machine learning algorithms in a project? How do you choose the most suitable algorithms for your data set? How do you define the feature variables that can potentially be used for machine learning? Most data scientists ask these questions.  EDA answers these questions explicitly.
Also, EDA helps in understanding the data. Understanding the data brings familiarity with the data, giving insights on the best models that fit the data set, the features in the dataset that will be useful for building an accurate machine learning model, making feature engineering an easy process.

In this talk, I will give a detailed explanation on what EDA and data visualization are and why they are very helpful in building accurate machine learning models for analytics as well as enhancing productivity and better understanding for clients.

After this talk you'll know how easy it is to use Python and Python's machine learning libraries to teach a computer to play games.  You'll see a practical example of the same type of machine learning used by AlphaGo, and also get to find out which character in StreetFighter II is best to pick when playing your friends.

        Using Python to build an AI to play and win SNES StreetFighter II
      </a>",2018,"![ryu-python]

Hear the story of how we used Python to build an AI that plays Super StreetFighter II on the Super NES. We’ll cover how Python provided the key glue between the SNES emulator and AI, and how the AI was built with `gym`, `keras-rl` and `tensorflow`. We’ll show examples of game play and training, and talk about which bot beat which bot in the bot-v-bot tournament we ran.

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Recently, a new LED strip specification, APA102, has been released which allows these strips to be driven by a general purpose CPU instead of a dedicated microcontroller. This allows us the luxury of controlling them with Python!

I'll teach you about how to get the the hardware, how to think about programming for lights and how to build anything from a psychedelic art installation to home lighting to an educational tool. 

Programming with lights is awesome because you can SEE bugs with your eyes. I think the use of these LED's have great potential as a teaching tool because of the immediacy of the feedback.

LIVE hardware demos!  See Quicksort in brilliant colors!</div>","<p>

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Know you should be doing testing but haven’t gotten over the hurdle to learn it? pytest is Python’s modern, friendly, and powerful testing framework. When paired with an IDE, testing gets a visual interface, making it much easier to get started.

In this talk we cover “visual testing”: starting, learning, using, and mastering test-driven development (TDD) with the help of a nice UI. We’ll show PyCharm Community Edition, a free and open-source Python IDE, as a productive TDD environment for pytest. Specifically, we’ll show a workflow using pytest and PyCharm that helps make tests speed up development, or at the very least help to make testing seem less ""in the way"" of other development activities</div>","<p>

"<div class=""presentation-description"">How do you become a Python core developer? How can I become one? What is it like to be a Python core developer?

These are the questions I often receive ever since I became a Python core developer a year ago. Contributing to Python is a long journey that does not end when one earns the commit privilege. There are responsibilities to bear and expectations to live up to.

In the past year, I've been learning more about what it really means to be a Python core developer. Let me share all of that with you.

"<div class=""presentation-description"">Many of us practice test driven development, and pride ourselves in our code coverage. This is relatively easy to do when you begin a new project, but what happens when you take over an existing code base with little to no tests? Where and how do you start writing tests? This task can be very intimidating and frustrating, but can be accomplished!

This talk will run through some common approaches and methodologies for adding test coverage to pre-existing code (that you might not even be familiar with at all). The next time you take over an untested monolith,  you will be able to do the right thing and start writing tests instead of hoping for the best!</div>","<p>

"<div class=""presentation-description"">RESTful has been the go-to choice of API world. Why another API approach?
